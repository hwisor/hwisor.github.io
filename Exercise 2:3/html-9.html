        <p> At around the same time he was revising his book, <a href="html-10.html"> Carl Dair was producing a series of six pamphlets for West Virginia Pulp and Paper (Westvaco),</a> which he called "A Typographic Quest." </p>

        <p> Each booklet was, naturally, printed on Westvaco paper stock; like the lavish paper-company samples produced today, this series was meant to raise the profile of the manufacturer and encourage designers to think of Westvaco when specifying paper for their printing jobs. </p>

        <p> But these were quite modest productions: little saddlestitched booklets of about 30 pages, measuring 5-1/4 inches by 9, usually printed in two colors (the first one uses three colors throughout; the later ones are two-color, although the second color may change from sheet to sheet, with all three colors used together on the covers). The first "A Typographic Quest" was published in 1964; the sixth (and, as far as I know, final) came out in 1968, the year Carl Dair died. </p>
