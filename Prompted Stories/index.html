                <p class="bodytext"> You were never one for parties. You hated driving on rural roads to the middle of nowhere. Entering the party, you were disappointed to find that the only option was cheap beer. The vodka or gin was always gone by the time you arrived. Absolute fiends. The music playing was music you never listened to. And you couldn't dance. You never understood how it came so naturally to people. To make fools out of themselves. Eyes glanced all around the room, looking for that “one”. Never at you though. Never for you. The party showed no signs of slowing down, that it could go on forever. Until there was a chilling scream and a crash, and a girl laid faced down on the lawn. The music was replaced by boys shouting and girls crying. Looking down, you thought the party was just getting started. </p>

                <p class="bodytext"> I was washing dishes after Sunday breakfast when my youngest left me a stack of mail. She placed them on the wet countertop, where they quickly began to soak. I cursed at her as she ran back outside with the other children. I continued cursing under my breath as I circled through the wet junk mail. Credit card applications, coupon catalogs. I almost threw the whole stack away when I saw a letter from my son. My heart dropped to my stomach, as I hadn't heard from my eldest in two years. With shaky hands, I opened the envelope to find a piece of yellow paper ripped from a notepad. In pencil the note read, “$10,000. Not one dollar less. You cannot get him without it.” I left the house, leaving the water to run in the kitchen sink. </p>

                <p class="bodytext"> I never thought I'd see the Loch Ness Monster. I mean, I was a firm believer that he wasn’t real, and found it ridiculous that people still believed in him to this day. You’d think after the smartphone there would be hundreds of shitty vertical videos of him. But here I was, on my grandfather’s dock, when I saw him come up only a few yards away. It was dark, and I had first mistaken him for a sea lion because of his blubbery skin. It wasn’t until his neck kept rising endlessly from the water that I knew it was him. I went to grab my phone to record him passing by, but realized I had left it at home. As he descended back into the water, he sent out waves that were big enough to wash over the dock, soaking my pants.</p>

                <p class="bodytext"> You rushed down the corridor as military men chased after you. Their blue coats still streaky from the oil paint they left behind. You were startled not only by the weapons they had managed to take with them, but the brushstrokes that made up their faces. How they were moving in space. As they followed you into the next wing, you felt shame about how long you admired these men who you kept framed. You thought they would stay there in their own time. You could memorialize them from here. </p>

                <p class="bodytext"> Her body lay twisted by a tree. They found her in the early morning hours, when the rest of the world would be starting to wake. And it wasn’t long after they found her that they found him. And they asked him about the scratches on his neck. He tried to blame the cat, but she was declawed. He then claimed that she came onto him, and he was just defending himself. He said she said. Except she never got to say anything. </p>
